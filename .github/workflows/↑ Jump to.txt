Abstract
This specification defines the web developer rules (author conformance requirements) for the use of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1 and Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0 attributes on [HTML] elements. It also defines requirements for Conformance Checking tools.
Status of This Document
This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at https://www.w3.org/TR/.

ARIA in HTML is a [HTML] specification module. Any HTML features, conformance requirements, or terms that this specification module makes reference to, but does not explicitly define, are defined in the [HTML] specification.

This is a draft document and its contents are subject to change without notice.

This document was published by the Web Applications Working Group as a Working Draft. This document is intended to become a W3C Recommendation.

1. Web developer requirements for use of ARIA in HTML
Web developers MAY use the ARIA role and aria-* attributes on HTML elements, in accordance with the requirements described in [wai-aria-1.1], except where these conflict with the strong native semantics or are equal to the implicit ARIA semantics of a given HTML element. These constraints, are intended to prevent developers from making assistive technology products report nonsensical user interface (UI) information that does not represent the actual UI of the document.

Web developers MUST NOT use the ARIA role and aria-* attributes in a manner that conflicts with the semantics described in the § 2. Document conformance requirements for use of ARIA attributes in HTML table. Web developers SHOULD NOT set the ARIA role and aria-* attributes to values that match the implicit ARIA semantics defined in the table.

EXAMPLE 1
The following uses a role=heading on a button element. This is not allowed, because the button element has default characteristics that conflict with the heading role.
<button role="heading">search</button>
2. Document conformance requirements for use of ARIA attributes in HTML
The following table provides normative per-element document-conformance requirements for the use of ARIA markup in HTML documents and describes the implicit ARIA semantics that apply to HTML elements as defined in the HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 [html-aam-1.0] specification.

Each language feature (element or attribute) in a cell in the first column implies the ARIA semantics (any role, states, and properties) given in the cell in the second column of the same row. The third cell in each row defines which ARIA role values and aria-* attributes which MAY be used. Where a cell in the third column includes the term Any role it indicates that any role value apart from the implicit ARIA semantics role value, MAY be used. If an cell in the third column includes the term No role it indicates that authors MUST NOT overwrite the implicit ARIA semantics, or native semantics of the HTML element.

NOTE
Setting an ARIA role and/or aria-* attribute that matches the implicit ARIA semantics is unnecessary and is NOT RECOMMENDED as these properties are already set by the browser.

Element with a disabled attribute	aria-disabled="true"	
Use the disabled attribute on any element that is allowed the disabled attribute in HTML.

Only use the aria-disabled attribute for elements that are not allowed to have a disabled attribute in HTML.

Element with a placeholder attribute	aria-placeholder=""	
Use the placeholder attribute on any element that is allowed the placeholder attribute in HTML.

Only use the aria-placeholder attribute on elements that are not allowed to have a placeholder attribute in HTML.

Element with a required attribute	aria-required="true"	
Use the aria-required attribute on any element that is allowed the required attribute in HTML. MUST NOT be set to false if the required attribute is set.

MAY also be used for elements that have an ARIA role which allows the aria-required attribute.

Element with a readonly attribute	aria-readonly="true"	
Use the readonly attribute on any element that is allowed the readonly attribute in HTML.

Only use the aria-readonly attribute for elements that are not allowed to have a readonly attribute in HTML.

Element with a hidden attribute	aria-hidden="true"	
Use the aria-hidden attribute on any HTML element.

Note: If an element has a hidden attribute, an aria-hidden attribute is not required.

Element that is a candidate for constraint validation but that does not satisfy its constraints	aria-invalid="true"	
The aria-invalid attribute may be used on any HTML element that allows global aria-* attributes except for a submittable element that does not satisfy its validation constraints.

Element with contenteditable attribute	aria-readonly="false"	Do not set aria-readonly="true" on an element that has a contenteditable attribute set.
The elements marked with No corresponding role, in the second column of the table do not have any implicit ARIA semantics, but they do have meaning and this meaning may be represented in roles, states and properties not provided by ARIA, and exposed to users of assistive technology via accessibility APIs. It is therefore recommended that web developers add a role attribute to a semantically neutral element such as a div or span, rather than overriding the semantics of the listed elements.

NOTE
Authors are encouraged to make use of the following documents for guidance on using ARIA in HTML beyond that which is provided here:

Using ARIA - A practical guide for developers on how to add accessibility information to HTML elements using the Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification (ARIA 1.1).
WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.2 - An author's guide to understanding and implementing Accessible Rich Internet Applications.
EXAMPLE 2
These features can be used to make accessibility tools render content to their users in more useful ways. For example, ASCII art, which is really an image, appears to be text, and in the absence of appropriate roles and properties would end up being rendered by screen readers as a nonsensical string of punctuation characters. Using the features described in this section, one can instead make the ATs skip the ASCII art and just read the caption:

<figure>
  <pre role="img">
  o           .'`/
    '      /  (
  O    .-'` ` `'-._      .')
      _/ (o)        '.  .' /
      )       )))     ><  <
      `\  |_\      _.'  '. \
        '-._  _ .-'       '.)
    jgs     `\__\
  </pre>
  <figcaption id="fish-caption">
    Joan G. Stark, "<cite>fish</cite>".
    October 1997. ASCII on electrons. 28×8.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
3. Case requirements for ARIA role, state and property attributes
Authors MUST use lowercase ASCII letters for all role token values and any state or property attributes (aria-*) whose values are defined as tokens.

EXAMPLE 3
Correct (conforming) examples:

<div role="radiogroup">...</div>

<a href="home/" aria-current="page">home</a>
Incorrect (non-conforming) examples:

<!-- DO NOT DO THIS -->
<div role="radioGroup">...</div>

<div role="RADIOGROUP">...</div>

<a href="home/" aria-current="Page">home</a>
4. Allowed ARIA roles, states and properties
Columns 1 to 4 of the ARIA Roles, States and Properties table provide an informative (non-normative) reference to the ARIA roles, states and properties permitted for use in HTML. All ARIA roles, states and properties are normatively defined in the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1 specification. Links to ARIA roles, states and properties in the table reference the normative Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1 definitions.

Column 5 of the ARIA Roles, States and Properties table, defines extensions to the Kinds of content (defined in the [HTML] specification) categories each role has when it is used on a HTML element. Column 6 defines what HTML elements can be descendants of an element with a particular implicit or explicit role value.

For example, an element with role=button is interactive content and therefore cannot contain interactive content descendants. A button element has an implicit role=button, so cannot contain any elements with role values that are in the interactive content category (identified in Column 3).

Examples of non-conforming descendants
<!-- conformance checkers will report an error -->

<button>
<div role="button">...</div>
</button>

<div role="button">
<button>...</button>
</div>

<div role="link">
<textarea>...</textarea>
</div>

5. Conformance
As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, NOT RECOMMENDED, and SHOULD NOT in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Conformance checkers that claim support for checking of ARIA in HTML, MUST implement checks for the document conformance requirements for use of the ARIA role and aria-* attributes on HTML elements as defined in this specification.

Documents MUST NOT use any role values with elements in the § 2. Document conformance requirements for use of ARIA attributes in HTML table, other than the corresponding role value (if any) as listed for that element in the third column, other than those indicated in the second column, which SHOULD NOT be used.
